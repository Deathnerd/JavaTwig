# JavaTwig
A Java implementation of Twig (mostly translated from the original PHP source)

This is just an exercise (though preg_match_* functions may make it futile) in writing Java by taking something I'm interested in (Twig and language parsing) written in something I'm _*very*_ familiar with (PHP) and writing it in something I'm still pretty familiar with (Java) but not as much as the other thing. I claim no creative authorship on Twig except the Java specifics of this implementation.
